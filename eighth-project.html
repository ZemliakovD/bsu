                            <h3>DEVELOPMENT OF METHODS, MODELS AND SOFTWARE FOR THE ANALYSIS OF MULTICHANNEL LUMINESCENT IMAGES OF CANCER CELLS</h3>
                            <div class="case-info-text">
                                <p>Grant GPNI for 2016-2018 of the program "Informatics, space and security" 05.13.01 "Development of methods, models and software for the analysis of multichannel luminescent images of cancer cells".</p>
                                <p>As a result of the study, a formalized logical representation of the luminescent images of cancer cells was developed, on the basis of which a simulation model was built, which allows simulating multichannel images of cancer cells, taking into account the degree of grouping of cells, their overlap, as well as distortions resulting from image registration. A comparison was made between simulated and experimentally obtained images by the intensity distribution in all color channels and by the area of ​​cell nuclei.</p>
                                <p>Analyzed noise reduction methods. The methods of NLM, SAFIR and BM3D, which received repeatedly the highest marks in comparative reviews published in scientific articles, were considered. The best results were obtained for the non-local averaging method NLM. The advantages of the NLM method are speed of execution, good noise elimination while maintaining the boundaries of objects.</p>
                                <p>An algorithm has been developed for segmentation of the boundaries of cytoplasm of cells in order to isolate the cancer biomarker outside the cell nuclei, which allows automatic estimation of the size of the nuclei. An algorithm has been developed to restore information about the pixel intensity of the cytoplasm of cells. The basis of the information recovery algorithm is the application of the principal component method. A study was conducted of various combinations of components of the image to achieve the best segmentation of the boundaries of the cytoplasm of cells in the space of the main components. The algorithm is based on the threshold method. To separate the cytoplasm of the fused cells was used water separation method with filtering by the method of Gauss. The best results were obtained with a combination of raising to the power of pixel intensity.</p>
                                <p>Selected the most informative features of segmented objects. As a result of the work performed, 11 of the most informative features (classification error 0.110) were selected from 59 geometric features of the form to describe the nuclei on the luminescent images of cancer cells while preserving the accuracy of the classification of objects. Time costs as a result of reducing the number of signs for the description of objects were reduced by 2.3 times. As a result of analyzing the characteristics of the intensity distribution, it was shown that the 6 most informative features found were completely sufficient to describe all the objects. At the same time, the classification accuracy is maintained and amounts to 0.025. When using only 2 of the most informative features (upper quantile of intensity in the red channel and expected value in the green channel), the classification error is 0.03, which is sufficient for confident classification of objects in images. Time costs as a result of reducing the number of signs for the description of objects were reduced by 3 times.</p>
                                <p>The developed algorithms and models are implemented in the CellDataMiner software product, which integrates the object-oriented methodology for analyzing biological objects of luminescent images at the pixel level with the subsequent use of data mining methods to isolate cancerous groups. Technical and experimental testing of the developed software package CellDataMiner on simulated and experimental data was carried out. The analysis of the biomedical images provided by a foreign partner (137 units) obtained in the course of experiments on the study of microchips of tissues of mammary gland tumors was performed. As a result of the study, the number of cancer and non-cancer cells in each of the studied images was determined. The total number of cells varies between 1000 and 3000. The number of cancer cells varies between 100 and 1700. The results of the analysis demonstrate that the selected signs allow you to successfully select clusters of objects in the images. It should be noted that the use of form parameters is sufficient for successful classification of objects. The nuclei of cancer cells for the most part are larger than the nuclei of healthy cells. For noncancerous objects, greater expression in the blue channel is characteristic than for cancer cells. It should be noted that the green dye is used only for the cytoplasm, however, its accumulation in the nuclei of cancer cells is more intense than in the nuclei of healthy cells.</p>
                                <p>According to the results of work, 2 articles were accepted for publication and 1 article was published in peer-reviewed scientific journals, 3 articles and 1 thesis of reports at scientific conferences of different levels were published, 2 acts on the use of research results in the educational process were issued, and one act on practical the use of research results in the Republican Scientific and Practical Center of Oncology and Medical Radiology named after N. N. Alexandrova and some guidelines for laboratory work.</p>
